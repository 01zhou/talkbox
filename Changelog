	* Add a cython version of direct implementation (wo FFT)
	autocorrelation
	* Add argument to optionally use direct autocorrelation in lpcres;
	this makes lpcres several times faster for typical LPC order/windows
	size ration in speech processing.

	* Add a function slfilter in tools to filter a set of windows
	* Add a cython version of slfilter
	* Use slfilter to implement rank 2 of linpred

	* Fix some major memory leaks in levinson C code
	* Fix DCT with fft backend
	* Release 0.2

	* Fix bug in levinson error computation (data given to
	PyArray_NewFromData was not allocated on the heap).
	* Autocorrelation now is the biased estimator (fix discrepancy with
	matlab for lpc)
	* Initial version of arspec
	* Better error handling of input errors in C levinson

	* levinson is implemented in both python and C (C only support real
	double; python version can do complex numbers)
	* lpc implemented (support axis argument)
	* simple periodogram implemented
	* 0.1 release
